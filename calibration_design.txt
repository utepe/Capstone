When mode is switched to CALIBRATION

    1. Wait 5 seconds
    2. Prompt "OPEN" using LED (take timestamp)
    3. Wait 2 seconds
    4. Prompt "CLOSE" using LED (take timestamp)
    5. Wait 2 seconds
    6. Repeat 5x

Data from this time period stored into a structure with columns:

time | command | MCP (mV) | PIP (mV)

During an interval in which hand is "OPEN" or "CLOSED", take min/max according to glove description file. 

Curve Fitting can be done linearly or 3rd-order on each PIP and MCP joint

Linear: average "OPEN" value and average "CLOSED" value and fit with y = mx + b

Once all m and b values are calculated for mcp, pip_0, pip_90 maybe store those into relationship_file 
ex) { "index_mcp": [m, b], "index_pip_0": [m, b], "index_pip_90": [m, b] } 
this would be easier to implement if unity to pico via tcp/serial isnt possible

MODE switches back to UNITY
